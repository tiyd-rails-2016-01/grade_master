This application is a very basic app that allows teachers to create, store, and update student grades. Teachers can create multiple students and parents and (optionally) allow students and parents to log in to view grades.

Please contact the developer for more information!

* Parents are able to log in and select to receive weekly grade reports for their students. These emails will be sent on a weekly basis, on Fridays, and will include all grades added for that student in the past week.
