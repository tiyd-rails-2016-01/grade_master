This application is a very basic app that allows teachers to create, store, and update student grades. Teachers can create multiple students and parents and (optionally) allow students and parents to log in to view grades.

New Features!

  * Teachers can now upload .pdf files that correspond to a grade they are entering. An upload file button can be found on the create an assignment grade page. The .pdf can be viewed on the assignment grade index page.
  * Parents are able to log in and select to receive weekly grade reports for their students. These emails will be sent on a weekly basis, on Fridays, and will include all grades added for that student in the past week.
  * Students can now receive points based on achievements they have earned. Ten achievements are currently available, each with their own point total associated. As a teacher - you may complete achievements for a student by going to "Manage achievements" and clicking on the corresponding student. There is also a link to "Manage achievements" on the edit page for students.
