This application is a very basic app that allows teachers to create, store, and update student grades. Teachers can create multiple students and parents and (optionally) allow students and parents to log in to view grades.

Please contact the developer for more information!


* Styling of the app uses the Bourbon CSS framework. Tables, forms, and headers/footers use components of Bourbon's Refills library for a more user-friendly layout and design.
